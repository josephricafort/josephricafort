See the world through visuals made useful and beautiful

👋 Hi, Joseph here! 👀 I like to create different forms of visual explorations from maps, charts to interactives. Visit my seeds of creations I've been planting in a while in my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/josephricafort) page or send me an [email](mailto:josephricafortjr@gmail.com). Let's watch our creations grow, harvest and enjoy the fruits 🥭🍌🍍.
